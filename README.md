## 📂 Project Showcase

### 1. Titanic Survival Analysis
**Domain:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

*Analyzed survival patterns from the historic Titanic disaster to understand human behavior during crises.*

**What I did:**
- Explored how socio-economic class, gender, and age influenced survival rates.
- Created multi-variate visualizations to isolate key survival factors.
- Discovered that women and first-class passengers had significantly higher survival probabilities.

### 8. Vision AI: Digit Recognizer
**Domain:** Computer Vision (Basics)

*Built a neural network from scratch to recognize handwritten digits.*

**What I did:**
- Worked with pixel-level image data (MNIST dataset).
- Constructed a Neural Network architecture to interpret visual patterns.
- Achieved high accuracy in identifying handwritten numbers from 0-9.

### 9. Advanced Vision AI: Transfer Learning
**Domain:** Deep Learning & Transfer Learning

*Fast-tracked image classification by leveraging pre-trained state-of-the-art models.*

**What I did:**
- Utilized a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG/ResNet) to solve a new classification problem.
- Applied "Freeze" and "Fine-tune" techniques to adapt the model with limited data.
- Demonstrated how Transfer Learning significantly reduces training time compared to building from scratch.
