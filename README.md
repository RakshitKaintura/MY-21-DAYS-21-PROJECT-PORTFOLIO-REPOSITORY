# 21 Days, 21 Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my journey of building 21 data science projects in 21 days.

## About

I'm challenging myself to complete one data project every day for 21 days. Each project focuses on solving real-world problems using data analysis and machine learning.

**Progress:** 5/21 projects completed ✅
